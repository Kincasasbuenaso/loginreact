During this test you can follow your personal development process. Please keep in mind that we want to get a product that balances quality and quantity.

If you're not capable of finishing this test in its entirety in the given timeframe we still should be able to appreciate your work and skills.

Think about this small application as a project that will be maintained and possibly extended in the future by other developers.

Development

Build a simple web interface according to the provided design: https://www.figma.com/file/SKzL1MltQ1lj4U0uq68mzPxB/Front-End-Developer-Test?node-id=0%3A1


A concise and documented Git history is expected. When the development has been finished a Merge Request should be created in order to notify the technical team that the test is ready to be evaluated.
